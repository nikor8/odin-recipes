    <h2>A picture of the finished product! A classic in my household, this easy dish can be made in less than 20 minutes.</h2>
        <p>My beloved girlfriend turned me onto this dish. Essentially, it is some canned salmon, breadcrumbs, egg as a binder, a little bit of pan frying and voila! You have a little taste of heaven. A great snack to have in a hurry, I highly recommend making a dill pickle dipping sauce as well.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups plain yogurt or fat-free sour cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh dill, chopped</li>
            <li>2 (14.75-ounce) cans salmon packed in water (look for a sustainable brand)</li>
            <li>4 celery stalks, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dill sauce, whisk together the yogurt, mustard, and dill in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain the salmon, and then remove and discard the bones and skin. Mix the salmon, celery, onion, eggs, salt, and pepper in a good-size bowl. Form the mixture into 8 patties. Slick a medium skillet with the olive oil and heat it over medium-high heat. Cook the patties until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Put a dollop of the dill sauce on top of each patty and serve.</li>
    </ol>
