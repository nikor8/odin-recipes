    <h2>A picture of the finished product! A classic in my household, this easy dish can be made in less than 20 minutes.</h2>
        <p>My beloved girlfriend turned me onto this dish. Essentially, it is some canned salmon, breadcrumbs, egg as a binder, a little bit of pan frying and voila! You have a little taste of heaven. A great snack to have in a hurry, I highly recommend making a dill pickle dipping sauce as well.</p>
